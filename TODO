== TODO ==
* What do we do about queries that take too long? Perhaps use CONSTRUCT instead of DESCRIBE?
* Serve static pages
* Page title (non-URI) for non-DESCRIBE query
* Show the full spo table at the bottom of every page (regardless of CONSTRUCT or DESCRIBE)
* Allow the ability to Use different SPARQL endpoints and merge data
* Percentile indicators for some columns (e.g., population) in tabular data
* Maps for geo resources
* Exclude some of the triples that are auto-included by Paget
